Scripts that just use the nanopores library but add nothing to it should be located here.

To enable a smooth workflow and ensure that the nanopores module is correctly loaded from the top directory, you can add that folder permanently to your PYTHONPATH, e.g. by running the following in a shell (from this directory, in ubuntu):

>> cd ..
>> echo export PYTHONPATH='$PYTHONPATH':$PWD >> ~/.bashrc
